# A6-DFMSD
A6-DFMSD is designed to detect the seismic signals which originate from a pre-defined seismic target zone (e.g., a volcanic field) 
and are recorded by a local seismological network.  the most recommended targets for A6-DFMSD: 

a) regions newly covered by a local network  

b) detection of the new types of seismic sources (unknown waveforms) is desired

c) waveform matching detection methods are planned afterwards for monitoring seismic activity of a
certain target region, once reference waveforms are found.
